# Zodiac Sign Finder

The Zodiac Sign Finder is a Java console application that determines a person's zodiac sign based on their birth date. Users can input their date of birth in a "Date/Month" format, and the program will output the corresponding zodiac sign.

## Features
- Simple and user-friendly console interface.
- Accurate zodiac sign determination based on date and month of birth.
- Input validation for incorrect or invalid date formats.

## How to Run (No rocket science involved!)
1. Make sure Java is not just a type of coffee but also installed on your system.
2. Clone the repository (no, not with sheep, with Git!):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Jibin-Gigi/Zodiac-Sign-Finder.git
   ```
3. Navigate to the directory where you cloned the repo (use your compass if lost):
   ```bash
   cd ZodiacSignFinder
   ```
4. Compile the Java program (no, it won‚Äôt compile coffee beans):   
   ```bash
   javac ZodiacSignFinder.java
   ```
5. Run the compiled program
    ```bash
   java ZodiacSignFinder
   ```
6. Follow the on-screen prompt and enter your Date of Birth in ‚ÄúDate/Month‚Äù format (e.g., 08/May). <br>
   Please don't enter the year; we don't want to know how old you are! üôà
